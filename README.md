## Sofia (Day 1 & 2)

**City Center Exploration**

Sofia offers a gentle introduction to Bulgaria, with a compact city center that’s easy to explore on foot. During your two days in the capital, you can mix educational attractions with casual strolls and local dining. A great starting point is **Alexander Nevsky Cathedral** and the surrounding Old City area. Nearby, the pedestrian *Vitosha Boulevard* is perfect for an evening walk with the family – it’s lined with shops, cafes, and street entertainers.

For a kid-focused activity, consider the **Muzeiko Children’s Science Museum**. It’s a modern, interactive museum with three floors of hands-on exhibits geared toward children of various ages. Parents have noted that Muzeiko’s exhibits are engaging for adults too, making it a fun learning experience for the whole family. If the weather is nice, you can visit **Borisova Gradina**, Sofia’s oldest park, which has playgrounds and a lake for a relaxing afternoon.

**Where to Eat**  
Sofia’s city center has plenty of family-friendly restaurants:

- **Happy Bar & Grill**: A Bulgarian chain known for its extensive menu and good prices – ideal for traveling with children.  
- **Hadjidraganovite Kashti**: Traditional Bulgarian mehana (tavern) offering folklore ambiance and local grilled dishes that kids usually enjoy.  
- **Olio D’Oliva** (Italian) or **Rainbow Factory** (sandwiches & desserts) for international fare.

**Getting Around**  
Taxis are an easy way to get around Sofia with the family, especially if your hotel is outside the center. Official taxis are relatively inexpensive, and you can ask your hotel to call a reputable company (like OK Supertrans). Always check that the driver’s meter is running. Alternatively, the city has a convenient metro and bus network. But with just two days in Sofia, taxis and walking are simplest.

## Borovets (Days 3 & 4)

On Day 3, depart Sofia for the mountains – a drive of about 70 km (approx. 1.5 hours) brings you to **Borovets**, a historic mountain resort in the Rila range. Founded as a hunting retreat for Bulgarian royalty, Borovets is now a year-round resort at 1,300–1,400 m elevation. It’s an excellent place for the family to enjoy nature after the city.

**Hiking & Nature**  
In summer, Borovets turns into a base for hiking and outdoor adventures:

- Take the gondola lift up to attempt the ascent of **Mt. Musala** (2,925 m). Even a short walk after the gondola ride offers stunning mountain vistas.  
- For a shorter family-friendly route, consider the **Black Rock Trail**, passing through dense forests to a scenic viewpoint.  
- Horseback riding, mountain biking, and nature walks are also available.

**Why Borovets is Worth It**  
This stop provides a refreshing change of pace. You’ll experience Bulgaria’s natural beauty – from pine woods to panoramic Rila Mountain views. If time and energy permit, visit the **Seven Rila Lakes**, renowned glacial lakes reachable by a chairlift and moderate hike. In the evenings, unwind at your hotel’s spa or stroll the resort’s village center.

## Nesebar (Days 5 & 6)

A longer drive (about 5–6 hours) east takes you to **Nesebar**, a UNESCO World Heritage Site often called the “Pearl of the Black Sea.” The Old Town is situated on a small peninsula connected to the mainland by a narrow causeway, giving it a charming island-like feel.

**Historical & Cultural Significance**  
Nesebar’s history spans over 3,000 years, featuring:

- Remnants of ancient Greek settlements.  
- Byzantine churches with remarkable brickwork (e.g., **Church of Christ Pantocrator**).  
- Traditional 19th-century wooden houses.

**Exploring Old Town**  
Nesebar’s Old Town is compact and walkable – perfect for leisurely family exploration. You’ll find historic churches, an Archaeological Museum, souvenir shops, and local cafés. In the evenings, the old town is beautifully illuminated. If the kids need a change of pace, the nearby **Aqua Paradise Water Park** is a popular option, or you can enjoy the small local beaches.

**Family Tips**  
Nesebar is more laid-back compared to the lively Sunny Beach resort. The **Old Town** area has a unique charm, and two days allow you to enjoy its historic ambiance, plus some beach time if desired.

## Thracian Cliffs (Final Stop)

Conclude your trip at **Thracian Cliffs Golf & Beach Resort**, located in the Kavarna region about 50–60 km northeast of Varna. Known for its dramatic coastal bluffs and a world-class golf course, Thracian Cliffs offers a picturesque setting for relaxation.

**Leisure and Relaxation**  
After a week of traveling, it’s time to unwind. The resort features two private beaches (Bendida and Argata) in coves beneath the cliffs. Amenities include:

- **Spa & Wellness** treatments.  
- Cliff-top infinity pools.  
- Multiple on-site restaurants.

**Meeting Your Friend in Varna**  
One reason to choose Thracian Cliffs is its proximity to Varna, Bulgaria’s largest coastal city. It’s only a 50-minute drive away, making it easy for your friend to visit you at the resort (or vice versa). The beaches, restaurants, and scenic golf course offer a beautiful backdrop for a relaxed meet-up.

## Accommodation Comparisons

### Sofia
- **City Center Hotel** (e.g., near Vitosha Blvd):  
  - Pros: Walkable to main sights, easy access to restaurants, saves taxi costs.  
  - Cons: Parking can be expensive, can be busier/noisier area.

- **Residential Area Hotel** (e.g., near the zoo or outskirts):  
  - Pros: Larger rooms, quieter environment, sometimes lower cost.  
  - Cons: Requires taxi or public transport to reach the center. Less convenient for a short stay.

**Recommendation:** Opt for a **central location** if you only have two days, to maximize sightseeing time and minimize commuting.

### Borovets
- **Hotel Rila**: Central in Borovets, near the ski lifts, with an indoor pool and spa. Perfect for immediate access to hiking and resort facilities.  
- **Yastrebets Wellness & Spa**: Quieter, surrounded by pine forests, a short drive to the resort center. Great for a peaceful, wellness-focused stay.

**Recommendation:** If convenience is a priority, choose **Hotel Rila**. If you want a retreat-like experience, **Yastrebets** is more secluded.

### Nesebar
- **Old Town Boutique Guesthouse**: Immersive experience, historical ambiance, smaller rooms, limited parking.  
- **Beach Resort Hotel** (New Nessebar or Sunny Beach): Larger complexes with pools, sometimes all-inclusive, but you’ll need short taxi rides to Old Town.

**Recommendation:** For cultural immersion, stay **in Old Town**. If you want bigger amenities (pools, kids’ clubs), pick a beach resort hotel nearby.

### Thracian Cliffs
- **On-site Suites**: Choose between Marina Village (closer to restaurants/beach) or Hillside Village (near the spa, cliff-top views).  
- **Nearby Alternatives**: Lighthouse Golf Resort or BlackSeaRama, but Thracian Cliffs is the prime location for an all-in-one experience.

**Recommendation:** Stay at **Thracian Cliffs Resort** itself to enjoy beach access, sea views, and the convenience of on-site dining and activities.
